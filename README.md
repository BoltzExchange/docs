# Welcome to the Documentation of Boltz! ✨

## What is Boltz

Boltz is a privacy first, non-custodial bitcoin exchange built on top of layer two scaling technologies like the Liquid and Lightning Networks. With Boltz, users can seamlessly move their Bitcoin between different layers e.g. in order to use advanced financial products or manage liquidity of their lightning channels. All Boltz Swaps are atomic and thus non-custodial - users can always rest assured to be in full control of their funds throughout the swap flow.
